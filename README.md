# Saxify
This is a project to cgenerate dissimilarity matrices from Music Recordings data.
The SAX symbolic approximation technique is used to compress multidimensional time-series data.
PAM (partitioning around medoids) clustering is performed on the dissimilarity matrices - which can be for complete
recordings, or for sections defined in a map.csv file
